# One-handed acces in 3D video-game prototype
# Made by Inga Sedova (20003336)

To open the project it requires a installation on Unreal Engine 4.
Once that is installed run the FinalProject file and it will prompt a message saying that the file needs to be rebuild with missing standart settings.

To test out the prototype features, it is required to use a gamepad controller (for this case, the layot was designed to support the PS4 gamepad controller)
It is possible to use the keyboard but some of the features such as changing the control input scheme is not possible to so without a gamepad controller.
